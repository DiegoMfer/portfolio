			<h1>Hello fellow researcher</h1>
			<p>
				I'm Diego MartÃ­n FernÃ¡ndez, a Software Engineer with a degree from the University of Oviedo and currently a researcher at <a href="https://www.weso.es/">WESO</a>, a research group focused on Knowledge Graphs and Semantic Web technologies.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				My passions lie in programming, data structures, and all things data-related. I have valuable experience in both research and private sector technologies, bringing a well-rounded perspective to the work I do. My goal is to ensure that the projects I engage in provide real value beyond just enhancing my resume.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				As for my personality? Let's just say, my family calls me "weird"â€”but I like to think of myself as being **freaking awesome** ðŸ¥µðŸ¥µðŸ¥µ.
