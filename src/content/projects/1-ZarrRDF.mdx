### Abstract
Handling large RDF graphs is usually a challenge that can require big amounts of resources making it difficult to process the data in personal computers or other devices.
This paper addresses that challenge by proposing the use of Zarr, a data partitioning technology commonly employed in bioimage processing.
Zarr facilitates the partitioning of large datasets into manageable chunks, enabling the processing of data exceeding available memory capacities.
By leveraging Zarr, it is possible to overcome the scalability limitations of traditional RDF databases, 
thereby enhancing their usability and efficiency in managing large datasets.
In this paper we propose a system that stores RDF data in Zarr, enabling it to handle large RDF data in the server obtaining parts of it in the client on demand.
