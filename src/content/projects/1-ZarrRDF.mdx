### TL;DR
A project that stores RDF in Zarr, a data format used for storing images.

### Repositories
The name of the project has to be changed in the repo. There are two projects, one for the library implementation and another for the automated execution of the benchmarks.

### Abstract
Handling large RDF graphs is usually a challenge that can require significant resources, making it difficult to process the data on personal computers or other devices.

This paper addresses that challenge by proposing the use of **Zarr**, a data partitioning technology commonly employed in bioimage processing. Zarr facilitates the partitioning of large datasets into manageable chunks, enabling the processing of data that exceeds available memory capacities.

By leveraging Zarr, it is possible to overcome the scalability limitations of traditional RDF databases, enhancing their usability and efficiency in managing large datasets. In this paper, we propose a system that stores RDF data in Zarr, enabling it to handle large RDF data on the server, while obtaining parts of it on demand by the client.
